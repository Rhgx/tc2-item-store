This is a little project I made for a game I play on Roblox called [Typical Colors 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/328028363/Typical-Colors-2) to display my inventory. By writing a JSON file inside of the scripts.js file, the user can input the items **name, rarity, category, the unusual name (if it is a unusual), if the item is tradeable or not, an alternative name for it to show up in the search bar (incase the item is named) as well as a image** for said item.
