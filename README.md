This is a little project I made for a game I play on Roblox called [Typical Colors 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/328028363/Typical-Colors-2) to display my inventory. By writing a JSON file inside of the scripts.js file, the user can input items : **name, rarity, category, the unusual name (if it is a unusual), if the item is tradeable or not, an alternative name for it to show up in the search bar (incase the item is named) as well as a image** for said item. These are then displayed on the site for people to search and categorized into the categories : **weapons, cosmetics** and **other**. There is also a audioplayer included that can play multiple audios after one another (similar to a mixed playlist).
